Gameplay Overview
-------------------
Simple CPP Game is a simple ggame, written in C++, that shamelessly rips off Atari's classic, *Pong*.

Gameplay is simple: use W/S or Up/Down to steer your paddle to bounce the ball back to your AI opponent. If you miss, the AI wins.
If the AI misses, you win! Games are played in a best-of-1 format.
